# Reminder-Project
A Project developed in C language which alerts the user about any particular event or important dates on the specific day which are previously registered in this program,  through an alarm and popup once he has logged into the system.


About the project


Unzip this projects.zip file, you may have challenges compiling on your box, i compiled using MS visual studio..but used just basic c compiler and hence it should work on your box too.
You should see 2 folders called : Keerthana and Scanner
The zip files have exe files as well, had to rename it to eee for email security purpose. When I put scanner program in startup, like it said it will pop up and beep too about the event registered on that particular day.
